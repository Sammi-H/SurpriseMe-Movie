Surprise Me Movie App

The Surprise Me Movie app is a simple and interactive web application that helps users discover random movies or TV series. Users can select a genre and a year range, and then click the "Surprise Me" button to generate a random movie or series suggestion. If the user doesn't like the suggestion, they can click "Surprise Me Again" to get a new one. Additionally, if the movie or series has a trailer available on YouTube, a "Watch Me Trailer" button will appear, allowing users to view the trailer directly on YouTube.

Features

Random Movie/Series Generator: Users can choose a genre and year range, and click the "Surprise Me" button to get a random movie or series suggestion.
Watch Me Trailer Button: If the selected movie or series has a trailer available on YouTube, a "Watch Me Trailer" button appears. Clicking it redirects the user to YouTube to watch the trailer.
Surprise Me Again: If the user doesn't like the movie or series, they can click the "Surprise Me Again" button to generate a new suggestion.

Technologies Used

HTML: Provides the structure of the app, including the form elements, buttons, and movie/series display area.
CSS: Styles the app's layout, color scheme, and ensures responsiveness with media queries for mobile and desktop views.
JavaScript: Manages the dynamic functionality of the app. It fetches data from the TMDb (The Movie Database) API, displays movie and series details, and controls the interactivity, such as generating random suggestions and checking trailer availability on YouTube.
